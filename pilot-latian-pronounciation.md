Here is a complete Pilot Voice Training Script.

Since you are in Indonesia, I have included "Cara Baca" (Phonetic Guides) suited for an Indonesian tongue to ensure the AI detects the specific "plosive" sounds (Letupan) required.

Print this out for your pilot.

🚁 RDK X5 Voice Command Training Script

Objective: Train the pilot to speak with "Machine Clarity."
The Golden Rule: Spit the Consonants. (Tekan dan letupkan huruf mati).
Focus: The AI struggles with soft endings. You must exaggerate the K, T, and P sounds.

PART 1: The Vocabulary Drill (Latihan Kosakata)

Read these words slowly. Focus on the bold/capitalized letters.

1. COMMAND: DISTRIBUTE (Payload)

Cara Baca: "Dis-TRIB-yut"

Key: The "TR" must be sharp. The final "T" must be clear.

Don't say: "Distribu" (Hilang T) or "Dis-trict".

Practice: "Dis... TRIB... yute."

2. COMMAND: VIRGINIA (Camera)

Cara Baca: "Ver-JIN-ya"

Key: Use a soft "J" sound (like Jakarta), not a hard "G" (like Gudang).

Don't say: "Fir-gi-nia" or "En-gi-neer".

Practice: "Ver... JIN... ya."

3. COMMAND: SUBDURAL (Control/Override)

Cara Baca: "Sab-DYOOR-al"

Key: Emphasize the "SUB". Roll the "R" slightly if needed, but keep "Dural" distinct.

Don't say: "Sub-total" or "Federal".

Practice: "SUB... dural."

4. KEY: SCARLET (Red / Right)

Cara Baca: "SKAR-leT" (Letupan T keras!)

Key: The "K" must be hard. The final "T" is the most important sound.

Don't say: "Skar-le" (Weak T) or "Star-let".

Practice: "Skar... LeT."

5. KEY: COBALT (Blue / Left)

Cara Baca: "KO-bolT" (Letupan T keras!)

Key: Do not say "Kobal". You must hear the "LT" sound at the end.

Don't say: "Go Bold", "Global", "Kabel".

Practice: "Ko... BalT."

PART 2: The "Trap" Gauntlet (Latihan Anti-Salah Deteksi)

In this section, the pilot must read the False Phrase followed immediately by the Correct Command. This teaches the pilot to change their tone for the real command.

Instruction: Read the left column normally, then PAUSE, then read the right column with a "Robotic/Firm" voice.

Normal Voice (Trap)	ROBOTIC VOICE (COMMAND)
"The district attribute."	"DISTRIBUTE... SCARLET."
"Go bold and hold."	"DISTRIBUTE... COBALT."
"This tribute is distinct."	"DISTRIBUTE... SCARLET."
"The engineer has a version."	"VIRGINIA... SCARLET."
"It is virtual and linear."	"VIRGINIA... COBALT."
"Sub-total the federal."	"SUBDURAL... SCARLET."
"Global cable stable."	"DISTRIBUTE... COBALT."
"The starlet has a wallet."	"DISTRIBUTE... SCARLET."
PART 3: The "Go Bold" Stress Test (Tes Akses)

This is the specific test to fix the issue where "Go Bold" triggers "Cobalt".
Pilot must pronounce the 'T' in Cobalt sharply.

Repeat 5 times:

"I will go bold, but the drone is COBALT."
(Ay-wil-go-bowld ... bat-de-dron-is-KO-BAL-T)

Repeat 5 times:

"Not a Starlet, it is SCARLET."
(Not-a-Star-let ... it-is-SKAR-LE-T)

PART 4: Full Operational Simulation (Simulasi Misi)

Read these full sentences. The AI should ONLY wake up when you say the capitalized words.

"Tower, this is RDK-X5. We are approaching the drop zone."

"Wind is distinct, velocity five knots from the district."

"Prepare to drop payload right. DISTRIBUTE... SCARLET."
(Wait for execution)

"Payload released. Checking the global link."

"Correction, go bold on the approach."

"Prepare to drop payload left. DISTRIBUTE... COBALT."
(Wait for execution)

"We have a visual on the target engineer."

"Switching video feed. VIRGINIA... SCARLET."

"Signal is sub-optimal, federal interference."

"Engaging manual override. SUBDURAL... SCARLET."

💡 Final Tip for the Pilot (Tips Terakhir)

"Think of the drone as a slightly deaf person. You don't need to shout (jangan teriak), but you need to enunciate (perjelas artikulasi).

Wrong: "Distributekobal" (Too fast).

Wrong: "Distribute....... Cobalt" (Too slow, timeout).

Right: "DISTRIBUTE [0.5 sec pause] COBALT."*
